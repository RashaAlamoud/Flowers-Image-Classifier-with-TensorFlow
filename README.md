# Flowers-Image-Classifier-with-TensorFlow
Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree

# Description
Keras/TensorFlow project done as part of the Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree. It consists on a modified version of Google's MobileNet Convolutional Neural Network, modified with a last layer to adap it to a 102-class flower classifier.

The classifier was trained with the oxford_flowers102 dataset from TensorFlow.

The saved model can be run from the predict.py script and can work with any image (it will try to classify it as one of the 102 flower classes that the model was trained on).
